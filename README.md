# MHCP-Mini-Tutorial
This repository was created to show a tutorial on how to create a 3D model in Blender from a reference image, to which texture painting is applied manually. It can then be imported into the Horizon World Desktop Editor in FBX format to be used as part of any virtual world you want to develop.
